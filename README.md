This is the stub README.txt for the "test" project.

### Notes

C interfaces use two namespaces: tags and names.  As a shortcut, they are interchangable here; assuming the headers are written withing C limitations, we can play fast and loose.

Anonymous structs, enums and unions wind up with a numeric tag, hopefully resolved with a typedef to a name.
